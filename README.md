ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Archana <br /> 
I am a Research Assistant at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), working on computer vision problems. <br /> 
My current area of interest is low power computer vision (object detection and tracking algorithms more specifically). <br /> 
Previously, I was a software engineer at [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) for 2 years working on the new [digital banking](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/gxs-bank-launches-new-savings-account-select-customers) team
